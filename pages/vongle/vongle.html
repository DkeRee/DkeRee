            During freshman year of high school, I was challenged to a little programming contest using Snap (Scratch, but made by UC Berkeley).
            I gladly accepted because I knew I could bring something to the table. I had not created something as big as Wanshot yet, but I knew I could make some kind of platformer.
            Growing up, I haven't played a lot of platformer games, but I did have an old gameboy where I touched on some classic mario. 
            I also knew that, with the restrictions of Snap, I couldn't make a large, slow-paced platformer game. I needed something with a hint of urgency.
            I do not quite recall what brought me to the conclusion that I needed to stuff the player inside an active volcano. To be honest, I think I probably saw some volcano go off on television.

            As always, with everything in this website, there's going to be a little bit more lore.
            My programming teacher bought us some prizes. I've checked back every year since then, and I still think that I greatly lucked out.
            The prizes during the past two school years have been some small stuffed animal or snack bag. Most notably, however, first place last year did get a Matoryashka doll, but in the form of a stuffed animal duck.
            It was supposed to be a joke about rubber-ducky programming, which is where you talk to a rubber duck you keep on your desk to plan out a solution to a bug when programming. I'd personally rather not develop schizophrenia over code.
            I acquired the legendary RGB gamer owl! I had my eyes on this darn thing since day one. To this very day, it still sits next to my work desk. Though, I don't talk to it when I'm stuck on something.
            Since then, this game has been one of the model games my teacher shows to new participants. Apparently, it took nearly two years for someone to figure out a cool easter egg I laid hidden in the game.
            I'm going to let you figure out what it is :) (Maybe the RGB owl put the easter egg in the game; who knows?)
