            What is your first? There is always a first. I've learned that history cannot be hidden no matter how successful something becomes. 
            That is why I try to never hide my first takes for anything. This right here is my first actual project EVER when it comes to programming.
            The code is public on GitHub. It is bad. It is not good. However, I'm not going to try to hide that my first code was bad. Nobody is really good at anything first try. Things take time to form results.
            Corcle uses the Matter.js library for its physics. Use the WASD or arrow keys to maneuver through each level. Keep in mind that there IS NO DELTATIME for this game, meaning that it will run at different speeds proportional to your frames per second or the refresh rate of your monitor!

            There are only SIX levels in this game, but the last three are excruciatingly difficult.
            Just like Wanshot, you will have infinite lives, but in true fashion of a rage game, I have put a death counter on the top of your screen.
            The idea to get through each level is very simple. You can touch the white blocks. You cannot touch the red blocks. The orange pads launch you, and the blue ones teleport you.
            Though, do watch out, there is a level in the game that tricks you. Since this game is extremely difficult to beat, I am going to link a speedrun I did a couple years back down below.
            As another treat, I will also link my VERY FIRST website below as well to commemerate the FIRSTS. (Warning: it's pretty bad; I was like 12 or 13 when I made it)
