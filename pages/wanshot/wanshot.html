            When I was just a little kid, my dad bought me the Wii. At the time, the Wii was basically like the current Nintendo Switch. 
            Everyone wanted one, but I was still too young to really crave for anything like that, so when I first set my eyes on the Wii, I didn't think much about it.
            There were only two games, which came with the set my dad bought, available for me to play: Wii Sports and Wii Play. To my surprise, to this very day, despite not caring about the Wii too much when I first got it, I have come to hold both games close to my heart.
            They have become a staple of my childhood. My game, Wanshot, is heavily inspired by specifically one of the minigames in the Wii Play series: Wii Play, Tanks.
            As you can clearly see, this is my favorite project. The background of my website is art in the style from this game, and so is my banner in the About Me!
            Fun fact, the background of my website is not a still jpg or png (picture). It is rendered directly in this website using CODE, so there will be no bluriness :)
            (However, do note, DO NOT play on FireFox; for whatever reason it is extremely laggy on that specific browser)

            The name, Wanshot, cleverly represents how you only have ONE SHOT to beat a level in a campaign. I have to give credit to Bigman, a good friend of mine who's currently majoring in Chemistry, for coming up with this name.
            The "W" is a reference to the fact that this game is inspired by the Wii Play series (hence the W).
            The art you see to the right is made by Mufat, another good friend of mine. He made it in Blender and it currently serves as the background in the starting screen (though the game isn't in 3D, heh).
            The IDEA of this game is rather simple. You, as the player, will control the BLUE tank to eliminate all the enemy tanks. If you kill all the enemy tanks in one go, you can move onto the next level in an entire campaign. If you die, you will have to restart the level you didn't beat (all previously dead enemy tanks will respawn).
            In the normal gamemode, there are INFINITE LIVES! So try your darn best to beat it all! In the regular campaign I have already made for you, there are 20 levels in total (normal campaign). Good luck!

            In Wanshot, you can also lay MINES by pressing space! You can lay up to three. Each mine will automatically go off after a period of time.
            However, you can also alternatively shoot mines to make them explode. Unexploded mines in the radius of mines undergoing an explosion will ALSO explode, so you can set off a CHAIN EXPLOSION. 
            Watch out for tanks that lay mines! Things are always a little chaotic when everything is exploding. 
            Shells, which you can shoot by left or right clicking, can kill enemies in ONE SHOT and can bounce off walls ONCE. However, the same rules apply to YOU as well! Watch out for shells from enemy tanks (especially the special ones!).
            On a first runthrough, this game can provide 2-3 hours of gameplay with VARIOUS types of enemy tanks that EACH have their own abilities and detriments. You must learn to adapt and counter these tanks throughout each campaign :)
            If you are worrying about replayability, do not fret, for there is a LEVEL EDITOR! Yes! you can create your OWN MULTI-STAGE CAMPAIGNS! After you beat the main campaign, go ahead and make your OWN!

            By clicking on the HAMMER ICON at the bottom of the page, it will take you to the LEVEL EDITOR. Here, you can create your own campaigns!
            On the left, you can select what type of tile you want to use. On the right, you can select what tank you want to place.
            It works like your usual level editor: click to place and click again to remove. Within the level editor, you can SAVE your campaign once there is at least ONE enemy tank and the player exists throughout EVERY LEVEL by pressing on the BOTTOM RIGHT save icon.
            You can upload your campaigns to work on once again by clicking on the BOTTOM LEFT up arrow icon.

            Similarly, in the main game, you can upload your custom campaigns to play through the SAME up arrow icon and then walking into the CUSTOMS green portal (which will light up if it goes through without any errors).
            Each campaign can hold up to 100 levels. Press the left and right arrows to toggle between levels (do note there is no level deletion feature just yet, so don't spam!). You can automatically add a new level by pressing on the right arrow when you're at the very end (N/N stages already existing).
            Once you complete the main NORMAL CAMPAIGN you can give the CHALLENGE CAMPAIGN a shot (but just a fair warning, it is REALLY HARD!)
            Though, to just keep in mind, your custom levels will be saved as a JSON file, so look out for one of those if you save your file and accidentally lose it in your pile of downloads!
            Also, the regular yellow tiles are non-removable. The red tiles can be destroyed with your mines.
            The game is OPEN SOURCED! You can access it on my GitHub (linked in both my website and my game).
