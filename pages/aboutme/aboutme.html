            Hey there! Welcome to my website. Here, you can find the various projects I have worked on over the course of my high school career.
            I began programming around 2019 before the world went into lockdown, and I found solace through this during the lonely periods of 2020.
            It was something that I had never done before, and there seemed to be infinite possibilities on what I could possibly make.

            Now, almost 5 years later, despite having changed a lot myself, I still hold great passion towards computer science and the fields that run parallel to it.
            With the advent of artificial intelligence around the corner, there are truly endless journies to startâ€”it only takes a few steps to begin.
            The butterfly effect is real. In a small IO game called Drednot, I met some of my best friends to this date, and one of them convinced me to take a look at Khan Academy to give computer science a shot.
            Through this effort, I took my first few steps and I had already begun without even knowing it.

            Let's not linger on what projects I have done right now. You'll have more than enough to read through by clicking on the other tabs.
            Since 2019, after entering high school, I've also discovered some new hobbies I now frequently partake in during my free time. 
            Asides from fishing, programming, and playing the piano, most prominently, I now run Cross Country and Track & Field.
            Now, I'm not the fastest guy out there. The playing field is very competitive. Despite having a sub-5 minute mile, I've never won a local race.
            Even so, I continue to run for myself. The fastest way to ruin something is to begin comparing. I run to relieve stress. I run for better health. I run because it only takes a few steps to begin and immerse myself in a new playing field to tackle.
            There may be a lot of hungry sharks in the tank, but that's what I perceive as a challenge. (don't throw yourself in a tank of sharks)
