            I wouldn't say that I was an IPad kid. After all, generation alpha was way after I was born. However, I will say that people blame generation alpha for being IPad kids way too much.
            When you have a cool tablet in front of you and you're a kid, you are going to want to play with it. You're definitely going to download some type of game at some point of time and get hooked on it.
            When I was a kid, I would download all sorts of games onto my dad's IPad 2â€”that is, until I dropped the thing on the floor and it broke.
            One of these games I played inspired Boxgle. Yes, Boxgle was one of my first "beginner projects" because it was so simple, but you simply don't see many things like it anymore.

            The game I played had you move around as a smaller square while being chased after by larger red squares, which would always move in a certain pattern, making the game a little bit skill-based.
            After many years, I have completely forgotten what the original name of the game was. I only remember having a lot of fun playing it with my friends in school.
            Thus, as a bit of a tribute (because the game could have very well been removed from the IOS app store along time ago) and practice with programming, I made Boxgle.
            There is another game that I do really want to make a tribute for. Right now, I'm a bit busy with other things in life, so maybe in the further future I will try to make a game like this one. 
            I have it shown on the left. It's called Zombie Fish Tank. It is one of the staple games of my childhood. I remember being both spooked out yet eager to play another level because of how well made it was. 
            Apparently, the sequel of the game was cancelled, and it is no longer playable on the newer versions of IOS. I have a little montage of it shown on the right.
