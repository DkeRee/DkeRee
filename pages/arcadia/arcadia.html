            When my APCS teacher told us that we had to make a game with actual graphics using Java Swing for our final, it brought me back to the Snap programming contest and Vongle.
            Just like how I felt with Vongle, I knew that I could make something excellent. Now, without the restriction of block programming, I truly had open seas to sail wherever I wanted to.
            By this time, I already had Wanshot somewhat finished. However, I didn't want to just copy and paste code over from my previous projects. Besides, I didn't want to remake something as complex as Wanshot for a school final.
            I thought about it for a little bit, and I decided to make a spinoff of my old game. I decided to make an arcade version of Wanshot, and honestly, it exceeded my expectations! Just like that, Wanshot: Arcadia was born.

            The game works just like Wanshot except that there are no mines, custom terrains, or explodable blocks.
            Instead of having infinite lives through a set number of levels in a campaign, however, it is a one-life runthrough of multiple levels and waves.
            The positions where enemy tanks spawn are randomized, and the number of waves per level and enemy tanks per wave is randomized as well.
            As you progress throughout the game, the tanks get harder and harder to beat as I introduce tougher and tougher "AI" to fight against you.
            Good luck! It is NOT an easy variant of Wanshot! Do note that if you wish to compile this program yourself, you MUST specify to your IDE that the Java resources folder is the one in the repository marked as “resources.” 
            This process differs between every IDE, so use best judgment while doing so.
